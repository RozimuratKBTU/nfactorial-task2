# Color-palette-Explorer
Color Palette Explorer is a web application that helps users explore and create color palettes. With this application, users can select individual colors from a color picker or use predefined color palettes. They can also adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness of each color, and create complementary or similar color schemes based on the chosen base color.
